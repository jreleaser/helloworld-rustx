= Helloworld in Rust

This repository shows how to configure link:https://github.com/features/actions[GitHub Actions] and link:https://jreleaser.org/[JReleaser] to:

 * compile a helloworld app for the following targets:
   ** aarch64-apple-darwin
   ** x86_64-apple-darwin
   ** x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
   ** x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
 * use cross to compile for aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
 * use `lipo` to generate an universal binary for apple-darwin
 * assemble zip distributions with JReleaser
 * create rolling early-acces releases with JReleaser on every push to `main` branch

Original code based on link:https://andresalmiray.com/releasing-rust-binaries-with-jreleaser/[Releasing Rust Binaries with JReleaser].
